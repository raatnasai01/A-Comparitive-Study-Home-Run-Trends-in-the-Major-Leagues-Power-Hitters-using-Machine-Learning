A Comparitive Study: Home Run Trends in the Major Leagues Power Hitters using Machine Learning
It is based on strike rate of the differnt batsman
This study applies machine learning techniques to evaluate and compare the performance measures of power hitters in Major League Baseball (MLB) based on home run trends. 
Various statistical metrics, including batting averages, slugging percentages, on-base plus slugging (OPS), and isolated power (ISO), are analyzed to assess player efficiency. 
Machine learning models are used to compute performance metrics, identify trends, and compare hitters across different eras. 
The study aims to provide an objective measure of home run productivity using data-driven insights.
